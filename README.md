# MongoDB Atlas with FastAPI

This is a small sample project demonstrating how to build an API with [MongoDB](https://developer.mongodb.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Check out the [MongoDB Atlas AWS App Runner Blog Post](coming-soon) which explains more functional and business aspects of this project.

This project was inspired by an awesome [blog post](https://developer.mongodb.com/quickstart/python-quickstart-fastapi/) - you should go read it!

Go make something and inspire someone else!!
